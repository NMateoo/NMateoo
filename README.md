### Hi everybody! 👋

I'm Nicolás Mateo Macías, student of DAW (Web Application Development). 💻

I'm currently living in Málaga, where I'm doing my internship at NTT Data. 🏢

I work with front and backend technologies, such as Angular and Springboot, as well as CSS frameworks, such as Bootstrap and Tailwind. 🎨

My passion is the backend, although I am good at design as well. 👨‍💻
